This is a git tutorial for working from 2 different locations. It requires
having an ssh server set up, and having access to it from the other location.
This is probably considered an intermediate level for using git, but please
email me any questions at miller.time.baby@gmail.com



So I want to use a git repo on home pc and laptop?!
Alright, home pc [home] is an ssh server, so do git init there
  home> git init

Then from the laptop whenever I need the repo and am ready to work..
  laptop> git clone home:path/to/.git

Then if I ever want to push that repo to the server..
  laptop> git checkout -b laptop

This names a new branch "laptop" and now I can push that.
  laptop> git push origin laptop

Then to receive the changes from that branch just have to merge.
  home> git merge laptop

And voila! I have successfully hacked remotely and collaborated my work!
