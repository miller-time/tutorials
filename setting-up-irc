###########################
1.1 Setting up IRC on Linux
###########################

This is possibly the easiest method. If you have a debian-based Linux distribution like Ubuntu,
you can try to run `irssi` from the terminal. It should let you know that you can just install it
if that program isn't already installed. You may need to run `apt-get install irssi` as a superuser.

irssi is a command line IRC program. Once it's running, the easiest setup is to just type this in the
program's shell.

	  /connect -ssl irc.cat.pdx.edu 6697

This will connect you to the CAT IRC server, using SSL to secure your connection. The 6697 part is the port
the server uses for a secure IRC connection. From here, you can skip to section 1.3

1.2 Setting up IRC on Windows
#############################

From Windows, I'm going to recommend you use Putty to ssh to a reliable server and set up a persistent session.
To start, you'll need to download Putty. If you're on a Windows computer at PSU you will just need to find the
executable on a shared drive. I recommend, if you are downloading Putty, to go to their website
http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html
Putty is a small program, and you'll simply want to create a shortcut to Putty.exe in a convenient place.

Setting Putty up is extremely easy. You will see 2 important boxes on the Configuration screen: 
'Host Name (or IP address)' and 'Saved Sessions'
The first time you run Putty simply type the following into the 'Host Name' box
    
    username@ruby.cat.pdx.edu

Replacing 'username' with your MCECS username. You can also choose a different server on the PSU network, or
use a personal server that has an IRC client installed. You'll want a reliable server that is going to have
generous uptime.

The next step is to type a session name in 'Saved Sessions'. You can just call it 'irc' if you want. Then click
'Save' on the right. All done. Click 'Open' and you'll have a terminal open on that server. From there you can
follow the steps in section 1.1. You may also want to see the advanced section 1.5 for things like ssh keys.

1.3 Screen
##########

This section is extremely important. By now you should know how to connect to an IRC server from a linux command
line. What we're going to do is set up a *persistent* connection to that server.
From the Linux command line, type the following

     screen

Then hit Enter (as the message on-screen suggests). You're now running screen. Pretty simple, huh?
Just wait. It gets better. Now you can start up any program you want. For now, we'll start irssi.
     
     irssi

Follow the normal instructions for connecting to the IRC server. (The command is shown in section 1.1)
Your IRC session is now running, and it's persistent! Too easy? Let's explain how. Next to 'detach' from
your screen session, do the screen command Ctrl-a d. That's the CTRL key and `a` at the same time, followed
by the `d` key by itself. You should see irssi disappear and have a message in your terminal that says 
'[screen detached]'. You can now also disconnect from your ssh connection. Typing `exit` or pressing Ctrl-d
will do so. You may be asking why we just did all this. Well let's reconnect to that same ssh server. Once
you've done so, type the following
       
       screen -r

If that worked correctly, your IRC session will appear magically! This is the suggested method for 'attaching'
and 'detaching' from your persistent connection. This way you will always be on IRC, whether you are actually at
a keyboard or not. You'll be able to see messages other people send you while you're AFK, and you won't be flooding
people's screen each time you join a channel or leave.

###############################
1.4 Non platform-specific steps
###############################

You're not quite done, just cause you've connected to an IRC server. You're just staring down an empty hallway
at this point. You'll want to step into a room now, or 'channel'. Some of the popular channels on the PSU network
are #cschat, #chat, and #support. You may hear of others. You also may hear of other servers with their own
channels.
To join one of those channels, for example I'll use #chat, type this command

     /join #chat

You can now talk to anyone else who is in this channel. There should be a names list upon joining. But if you
miss it, or want an updated list, type
     
     /names

If you want to know what your name currently is, or your 'nick', type

     /whoami

If you want to change it to something else, simply type

     /nick Charles

Or something other than Charles if you don't like that name. If you REALLY like the name you choose, you'll
probably want to register that nickname. Type the following for help on that topic.

     /msg NickServ help

This will get you started with using the NickServ service. The more specific command that will help is

     /msg NickServ help register

Just read the instructions carefully. Once you have the registration complete, the only way that nick will
be usable in the future is by authorizing. For help with this do

     /msg NickServ help identify

That's a pretty good starting point. Anything else would be considered intermediate or advanced setup.

1.5 Advanced Tips
#################

This section is not required in order to use IRC. But some of these things may make your life easier.

Setting up an SSH key can make it more secure and easier to connect to the server you run IRC from.
On linux there is a command to do this. A full set of instructions is here
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ssh-keygen

On Windows there's a special method for doing this. You'll need to download PuttyGen from the Putty website.
http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html
Setting up PuttyGen on Windows:
http://theillustratednetwork.mvps.org/Ssh/copSSH-WinSCP-KeyPair.html

There are other things you can do with ssh, try `man ssh` for the Manual Page. irssi is just one of
many clients that can connect to an IRC server. For more help with its features and commands you can just
type `/help` in irssi. Or check out their website, where they do have online documentation.
http://irssi.org/

Another IRC client that I personally really enjoy is Weechat. You may need to compile the program to use
it on your system or on the school campus. I have successfully done both simply by reading their documentation.
