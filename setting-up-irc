1.1 Setting up IRC on Linux
###########################

This is possibly the easiest method. If you have a debian-based Linux distribution like Ubuntu,
you can try to run `irssi` from the terminal. It should let you know that you can just install it
if that program isn't already installed. You may need to run `apt-get install irssi` as a superuser.

irssi is a command line IRC program. Once it's running, the easiest setup is to just type this in the
program's shell.

	  /connect -ssl irc.cat.pdx.edu 6697

This will connect you to the CAT IRC server, using SSL to secure your connection. The 6697 part is the port
the server uses for a secure IRC connection. From here, you can skip to section 1.3

1.2 Setting up IRC on Windows
#############################

From Windows, I'm going to recommend you use Putty to ssh to a reliable server and set up a persistent session.
To start, you'll need to download Putty. If you're on a Windows computer at PSU you will just need to find the
executable on a shared drive. I recommend, if you are downloading Putty, to go to their website
http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html
Putty is a small program, and you'll simply want to create a shortcut to Putty.exe in a convenient place.

Setting Putty up is extremely easy. You will see 2 important boxes on the Configuration screen: 
'Host Name (or IP address)' and 'Saved Sessions'
The first time you run Putty simply type the following into the 'Host Name' box
    
    username@ruby.cat.pdx.edu

Replacing 'username' with your MCECS username. You can also choose a different server on the PSU network, or
use a personal server that has an IRC client installed. You'll want a reliable server that is going to have
generous uptime.

The next step is to type a session name in 'Saved Sessions'. You can just call it 'irc' if you want. Then click
'Save' on the right. All done. Click 'Open' and you'll have a terminal open on that server. From there you can
follow the steps in section 1.1. You may also want to see the advanced section 1.5 for things like ssh keys.

1.3 Screen
##########

This section is extremely important. By now you should know how to connect to an IRC server from a linux command
line. What we're going to do is set up a *persistent* connection to that server.
From the Linux command line, type the following

     screen

Then hit Enter (as the message on-screen suggests). You're now running screen. Pretty simple, huh?
Just wait. It gets better. Now you can start up any program you want. For now, we'll start irssi.
     
     irssi

Follow the normal instructions for connecting to the IRC server. (The command is shown in section 1.1)
Your IRC session is now running, and it's persistent! Too easy? Let's explain how. Next to 'detach' from
your screen session, do the screen command Ctrl-a d. That's the CTRL key and `a` at the same time, followed
by the `d` key by itself. You should see irssi disappear and have a message in your terminal that says 
'[screen detached]'. You can now also disconnect from your ssh connection. Typing `exit` or pressing Ctrl-d
will do so. You may be asking why we just did all this. Well let's reconnect to that same ssh server. Once
you've done so, type the following
       
       screen -r

If that worked correctly, your IRC session will appear magically! This is the suggested method for 'attaching'
and 'detaching' from your persistent connection. This way you will always be on IRC, whether you are actually at
a keyboard or not. You'll be able to see messages other people send you while you're AFK, and you won't be flooding
people's screen each time you join a channel or leave.

###############################
1.4 Non platform-specific steps
###############################

You're not quite done, just cause you've connected to an IRC server. You're just staring down an empty hallway
at this point. You'll want to step into a room now, or 'channel'. Some of the popular channels on the PSU network
are #cschat, #chat, and #support. You may hear of others. You also may hear of other servers with their own
channels.
To join one of those channels, for example I'll use #chat, type this command

     /join #chat

You can now talk to anyone else who is in this channel. There should be a names list upon joining. But if you
miss it, or want an updated list, type
     
     /names

If you want to know what your name currently is, or your 'nick', type

     /whoami

If you want to change it to something else, simply type

     /nick Charles
