Download the Postgres source

Follow the INSTALL file that is included:
  	 - ./configure
		(make sure it completes, install any packages that are missing)
	 - make
	 - su
	 - make install
	 - adduser postgres
	   	(give it a full name, everything else optional)
	 - mkdir /usr/local/pgsql/data
	 - chown postgres /usr/local/pgsql/data
	 - su - postgres
	 - /usr/local/pgsql/bin/initdb -D /usr/local/pgsql/data
	 - /usr/local/pgsql/bin/postgres -D /usr/local/pgsql/data >logfile 2>&1 &
	 - /usr/local/pgsql/bin/createdb test
	 - /usr/local/pgsql/bin/psql test

At this point you'll have a prompt that says:
test=#

What we want is to now add the role for your normal username. The way I did this is the following commands, from
this prompt:
create role username login;
alter role username createdb;

      where username is your actual user name.

You may now quit PostgreSQL with "\q". You may then logout of your "postgres" user. This should return you to root.
Go ahead and logout and you should return to your normal user. The next step is to add the postgreSQL commands to
your path. I use a ~/.profile file to edit my path. Google the file for your setup. Here's what I added:
PATH=${PATH}:/usr/local/pgsql/bin
export PATH

You'll then need to source the file by typing "source ~/.profile" or just ". ~/.profile".
You should now be able to create a new database. By typing just:
createdb
psql
	you should end up at a prompt that says:
username=>
	but with your user name. This is the default database. You've successfully created your first one under
	your normal Linux profile!

=====================================================================================================================
The rest of this tutorial is for CS386.

Download the .sql files from the class website. There are 3 databases to set up.
If you're still at the previous database prompt use "\q" to quit. Then type the following:
createdb sailors
createdb spy
createdb library
	 This will create empty databases for each of the supplied sets of tables.
